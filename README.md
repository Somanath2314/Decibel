# Decibel
Developing an app to curb unnecessary honking in traffic and public spaces, our solution syncs with vehicle honking systems, showcasing decibel levels on mobile apps. With Flutter for the frontend and Firestore for the backend, we aim to promote self-awareness, urging users to minimize honking for a more considerate environment.
